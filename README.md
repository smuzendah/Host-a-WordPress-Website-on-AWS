# AWS WordPress Deployment Project

## Overview
This project focuses on deploying a WordPress website on Amazon Web Services (AWS) infrastructure utilizing various AWS services and resources to ensure high availability, scalability, and fault tolerance.

## Project Components
1. **Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)**:
   - Configured a VPC with both public and private subnets across two different availability zones.
2. **Internet Gateway**:
   - Deployed an Internet Gateway to facilitate connectivity between VPC instances and the wider Internet.
3. **Security Groups**:
   - Established Security Groups as a network firewall mechanism.
4. **Availability Zones**:
   - Leveraged two Availability Zones to enhance system reliability and fault tolerance.
5. **Public Subnets**:
   - Utilized Public Subnets for infrastructure components like the NAT Gateway and Application Load Balancer.
6. **EC2 Instance Connect Endpoint**:
   - Implemented EC2 Instance Connect Endpoint for secure connections to assets within both public and private subnets.
7. **Web Servers (EC2 instances)**:
   - Positioned web servers within Private Subnets for enhanced security.
8. **NAT Gateway**:
   - Enabled instances in both the private Application and Data subnets to access the Internet via the NAT Gateway.
9. **WordPress Hosting**:
   - Hosted the website on EC2 Instances.
10. **Application Load Balancer (ALB)**:
    - Employed an Application Load Balancer and a target group for evenly distributing web traffic to an Auto Scaling Group of EC2 instances across multiple Availability Zones.
11. **Auto Scaling Group**:
    - Utilized an Auto Scaling Group to automatically manage EC2 instances, ensuring website availability, scalability, fault tolerance, and elasticity.
12. **Version Control**:
    - Stored web files on GitHub for version control and collaboration.
13. **Certificate Manager**:
    - Secured application communications between the users and the websites using a Certificate Manager.
14. **Simple Notification Service (SNS)**:
    - Configured SNS to alert about activities within the Auto Scaling Group.
15. **Domain Registration**:
    - Registered the domain name and set up a DNS record using Route 53.
16. **Shared File System**:
    - Used Amazon EFS for a shared file system.
17. **Database**:
    - Employed Amazon RDS for the database.
